This challenge is part of qualifications for the NdH XV (Nuit du hack 15) CTF.
They provide us with step1.bin.

The flag is recovered with the strings command.

When the program is provided with the right flag it:
	- writes "well done" on the standard output
	- writes the next challenge binary on the error output

The aim is to recover the step2.bin

Validate the chal with the password.

I really loved this chal... maybe because I'm new to reverse and wish to learn :)
